                    <p class="text-75 mb-4">DeepSleep is a <a href="#hnsdefinition">Health Navigation System</a> consisting of a website and a companion app for IOS and Android that helps you achieve better sleep through:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Higher accuracy sleep measurement.</b>&nbsp&nbsp  Accuracy in sleep assessment is a mostly unaddressed challenge.  Multiple sleep tracker makers claim “highest accuracy” but the fact is that all sleep trackers have fault modes and biases and the best you can do is combine them to get a more accurate picture, which is precisely what the DeepSleep platform enables.  Further, we normalize scoring between these platforms so you can practically compare results.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Better sleep understanding and comparisons.</b>&nbsp&nbsp  Seeing one night’s sleep results is interesting, if you know what you’re looking for.  We display your sleep in a novel form:  the <i>Hypnochron</i>, a clock-like representation together with key stats, the <i>HypnoStats</i> that characterize your sleep.   You can compare these to your past nights sleep and your trends, but also to population and community averages to get a sense  of how you’re doing.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Tailored sleep solution recommendations.</b>&nbsp&nbsp  DeepSleep’s <i>Solver</i> is what makes DeepSleep ultimately actionable.  Many trackers can provide sleep data, but only DeepSleep helps you understand your sleep needs and deficiences and then solve for them efficiently and effectively!  And as your sleep needs change, DeepSleep's analysis and recommendations will as well.
                            </li></b>
                            <li><b>Sleep community support.</b>&nbsp&nbsp  DeepSleep community members are there for support or if you so desire, for competition and motivation.   Community members have also formulated their own conclusions with respect to sleep habits and are constantly trialing their own new sleep solutions.  The DeepSleep community helps you stay abreast of what’s working, what’s popular, and how well different approaches to sleep are working.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Sleep solution efficacy measurement.</b>&nbsp&nbsp   If you're wondering just how well a recommended sleep solution will work to address your specific sleep needs, we've got you covered!  DeepSleep's built-in "Trialing" feature allows you to track and share solution efficacy so that you can more quickly home in what works best for you!

                    <p class="text-75 mb-4">The fastest way to improve your sleep is to  measure it, diagnose your sleep needs, and then attempt to solve for these needs.  
                        And that's what DeepSleep helps you do!   
                        <p> If you are already using a sleep tracker, all you need to do is <a href="https://www.deepsleep.health/app">download the DeepSleep app</a> to your iPhone or Android phone, create a DeepSleep account and configure
                            the DeepSleep App to use your tracker.   Some trackers (e.g. Withings Sleep Mat) automatically connect to DeepSleep while others (e.g. Oura Ring) require you to 
                            'sync' with their apps before you can see your results in DeepSleep.  And if you have multiple sleep trackers, you're in even better shape:  DeepSleep combines their results
                            to yield the highest accuracy and robustness available!
